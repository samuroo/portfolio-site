                    I am a current Undergraduate student at the University of California
                    Santa Cruz studying Robotics Engineering with an Electrical 
                    Engineering minor.  I am passionate about engineering tools 
                    facilitate meaningful human interaction and contribute 
                    positively to society.

                    The work showcased on this site includes projects from my involvement
                    in Slugbotics Club, where I lead a team of undergraduate researchers
                    in a 3DoF robotic arm, as well as my contributions to the Robotic Control Lab,
                    and personal projects developed. These experiences have shaped my 
                    ability to learn, communcate with others and passion for robotics.

                    Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy slacklining, cooking, and 
                    playing hacky sack—activities that keep me grounded as I continue
                    exploring the world of robotics.
