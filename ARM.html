                &nbsp;&nbsp;ARM Team, a sub-team within the UC Santa Cruz club
                <i>Slugbotics</i>, is a research-based project aimed at developing a low-cost, open-source, modular robotic arm. 
                As a co-lead of the team, I helped guide both the technical and organizational direction. 
                This strengthened my leadership skills and introduced me to team management practices such as maintaining a 
                shared Bill of Materials (BOM) and creating a Notion workspace to streamline communication, 
                task assignments, and documentation among team members.

                        I helped create create a 3D CAD models using Onshape. The arm was designed to be modular and customizable, 
                        allowing for easy iterations. We created components using both Prusa printers and Bamboo Lab X1 Carbons.

                        I implemented forward and inverse kinematics in MATLAB using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention. 
                        This allowed us to compute the exact positions of the end effector based on joint angles and link lengths.

                        These calculations served as the foundation for simulation, trajectory planning, and closed-loop control. 
                        This step was essential for validating workspace and reachability.

                    <p>
                        Using the onboard Raspberry Pi (as its brain), I implemented a ball-following 
                        algorithm to detect colored objects in real time. The system processed video 
                        frames to extract the position of a target color blob and adjusted movement 
                        accordingly using a proportional-integral (PI) controller.

                    <p>
                        This algorithm was designed as a precursor to object approach and pickup behavior, 
                        potentially enabling the robot arm to autonomously locate and interact with specific items.

                        Our team had the opportunity to demonstrate the ARM project at OpenSauce 2023
                         in San Francisco, an event that celebrates maker culture, robotics, and open-source innovation.

                        architecture to a large audience. It demsonrated that collaborative open-source development is 
                        critical to moving the world towards a better place.
