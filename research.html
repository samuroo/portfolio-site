                &nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Robotics and Control Lab, my research 
                focuses on advancing robotics with an emphasis on 
                real-world applications in agriculture. One of our key
                 projects is enhancing the capabilities of the <i>Amiga</i> 
                 tractor, an autonomous electric tractor developed by 
                 <i><a href="https://farm-ng.com">Farm_NG</a></i>. 
                 Designed to support organic farming, 
                 the <i>Amiga</i> enables low-till weeding practices that reduce
                  the reliance on harmful pesticides and herbicides.

                        While testing the autonomous tram line navigation, the
                         Amiga occasionally strayed from its path, requiring an emergency
                        stop and manual re-adjustment. Currently, the tractor’s 
                        control systems require close physical proximity
                        to manage these essential functions.

                    <p>
                        To address the proximity issue of tractor control, 
                        the solution our lab came to focuses on developing a
                        mobile application that enables remote control 
                        via a virtual joystick, live video streaming, an emergency
                        stop button, reverse replay functionality,
                         and pause/play of autonomous operations.

                        The application is developed using Python 
                        and the Kivy framework, enabling cross-platform 
                        integration. Buildozer, a Python tool, is 
                        used to package the app for deployment on Android or iOS.

                        The current iteration, as shown in the figures, 
                        consists of the IP screen and the JoyStick tab. To 
                        utilize the mobile application, the user must 
                        first enable the <i>Amiga</i> server application 
                        (on the <i>Amiga</i>). Then should enter <i>Amiga's</i>
                         IP address and port into the app and select <i>LOAD</i>. 
                         Once successfully connected, in the JoyStick tab, 
                         the user can view a live video stream and control the movement.

                        To communicate between the <i>Amiga</i> and mobile devices, 
                        we decided to uitlize the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to create
                         server-client connection. This requires the <i>Amiga</i> and
                          device to be on the same network (typically hotspot or WiFi).
